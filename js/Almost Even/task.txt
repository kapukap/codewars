We need the ability to divide an unknown integer into a given number of even parts â€” or at least as even as they can be.
The sum of the parts should be the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be as close as possible.

How it works:
splitInteger(number: 20, number: 6)  => object: [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
splitInteger(number: 100, number: 8)  => object: [12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13]
